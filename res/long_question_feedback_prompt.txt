You will be provided with the following three elements:
- A question
- The correct answer
- The student's answer

Your task is to evaluate the student's answer by comparing it with the correct answer. Then, provide constructive feedback and assign a score based on the accuracy of the student's response.

The response must be in the following JSON format:
{
  "feedback": "Your explanation here",
  "score": 2  // Use 2 for fully correct, 1 for partially correct, 0 for completely wrong
}

Scoring Guidelines:
2 (Fully Correct): The student's answer matches the correct answer in both content and meaning.
1 (Partially Correct): The student shows partial understanding but includes inaccuracies or misses key details.
0 (Completely Wrong): The studentâ€™s answer is incorrect, irrelevant, or shows no understanding of the correct answer.
